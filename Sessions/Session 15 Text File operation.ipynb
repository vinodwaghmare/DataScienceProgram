      "    discount = float(mo.group(1)) / 100.0\n",

      "Positional-only parameters\n",
      "There is a new function parameter syntax / to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments. This is the same notation shown by help() for C functions annotated with Larry Hastings’ Argument Clinic tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following example, parameters a and b are positional-only, while c or d can be positional or keyword, and e or f are required to be keywords:\n",

      "def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):\n",

      "One use case for this notation is that it allows pure Python functions to fully emulate behaviors of existing C coded functions. For example, the built-in pow() function does not accept keyword arguments:\n",
